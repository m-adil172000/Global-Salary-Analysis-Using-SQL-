# üåç Global Salary Analysis SQL Project

Welcome to the **Global Salary Analysis** SQL project, where real-world business problems meet data-driven solutions. In this repository, I have solved 11 business scenarios using SQL, showcasing different personas such as Compensation Analysts, HR Consultants, Data Scientists, and Market Researchers to derive key insights from global salary data.

## üìÅ Dataset
The queries are based on a hypothetical dataset named `salaries`, which includes:
- `job_title`
- `experience_level`
- `employment_type`
- `salary_in_usd`
- `remote_ratio`
- `company_location`
- `company_size`
- `work_year`
